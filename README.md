# RubyResumeApp
App for building and printing Resumes to the terminal by importing JSON data

## Usage
At the moment, usage is just a simple

  ruby resume.rb -s SERVER -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD

## About

This is just a simple Ruby app for printing out my resume to the terminal.

Currently is done through basic authentication using the above syntax.

Resume is hosted from my own API that I also built strictly to serve this 
application and requires SSL support TLSv1.2 only.  

## Yo dawg

I heard you were lookin' for some Ruby, so I wrote a resume app in Ruby, 
that pulls from an API written in Ruby, so we can Ruby while we Ruby.
